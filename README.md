While still a work in progress, this repository is for my current project: a sentiment analysis paper based on the popular video game *Detroit Become Human*.

This project seeks to determine whether specific words are linked to higher rates of choice clickthroughs throughout the game. It will draw from the publicly available global game statistics,
calculated from 2018 and 2023 statistics. This will not only generate a significant body of data, but it will grant the means for comparison within data sets.

* The 2018 data set will be input into a `csv` file from [screenshots of the statistics](https://www.reddit.com/r/DetroitBecomeHuman/comments/99b65j/all_100_flowcharts_with_global_stats_included/) from
  Reddit user *throwawaydeviant9*.
* The 2023 data set will be input into a `csv` file too, but it will be taken from the universal statistics of my copy of the game.

This project will serve as a means to practice basic data science skills, learned from my class **COGS 108: Cognitive Science, Introduction to Data Science**, as well as expand my working knowledge of such
packages as `pandas` and `numpy`.
